<h1 class="text-center">Benjamin Barad <small> Graduate Student </small></h1>



Since 2013, I have been a graduate student studying Biophysics with 
[James Fraser at UCSF](http://fraserlab.com). I am investigating methods for 
structural modelling and validation as well as the structural links between 
mutation and disease. Before that, I was an undergraduate at Stanford 
University studying Biological Chemistry, where I worked with 
[Elizabeth Sattely](http://www.stanford.edu/group/sattelygroup/cgi-bin/wordpress/) 
investigating bacterial degradation of the plant polymer lignin.
