<p class="lead text-justify">
I am a structural biologist with a special interest in emerging computational and experimental methods in electron microscopy. I am currently working at Genentech, developing new software to help automate and accelerate the pipeline for solving structures with electron microscopy.  
I received my PhD in biophysics from UCSF in the lab of [James Fraser](http://fraserlab.com), where I developed methods for the building and validating atomic models generated from single particle electron microscopy, as well as investigating the mechanisms of activity of mammalian chitinases. 
Before that, I was an undergraduate at Stanford University studying Biological Chemistry, where I worked with [Elizabeth Sattely](http://www.stanford.edu/group/sattelygroup/cgi-bin/wordpress/) investigating bacterial degradation of the plant polymer lignin. 
  
 Beyond my scientific interests, I am excited about food and cooking, coffee, 3D printing, and games (tabletop, board, and video games all qualify).
