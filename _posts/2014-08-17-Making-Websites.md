Title: Making Websites

In the past few months, I have gone from having no experience whatsoever making websites to having made 2 static sites and a small in-progress webapp (which I hope to share soon!). It has been a tremendous learning experience for me, but something that I found difficult starting out was just figuring out what technologies to build from.

I have only been programming for about 18 months, and in that time I have primarily gained experience working in Python. I have very little knowledge of web technology beyond the basics that I have cleaned from reading stackoverflow. Because of this, all of the success I have found in websites so far has been from starting with a very well-developed framework and tinkering from there. Given that I am only interest in web development as a means of making publically available the work I am doing, I think that I probably will not progress past this point. However, I thought I would share my experiences with some of the tools that I have used both for building the static sites as well as the webapp that might be of interest to others in my position.
